st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).


FreeBSD added instructions:                                         
----------------------------------------------------------------
change "X11INC = /usr/X11R6/include"
to "X11INC= /usr/local/lib"

Change "X11LIB = /usr/X11R6/lib"
to "X11LIB = /usr/local/lib"

and install the packages "pkgconf" and "freetype2" with:
pkg install freetype2 pkgconf
----------------------------------------------------------------

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
